TP-tests
========
Made by: Alexander Iliev 11b & Dimitar Velev 11b

The program creates an N number of tests with a difficulty chosen by the user, stores the tests and their results in a txt and html file (separately).

Usage:

ruby test.rb N mode

If you pass "hard" as mode, the test will be harder. If there is no mode argument the tests will be easy by default.
